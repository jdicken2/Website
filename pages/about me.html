    <h1> About Me </h1>
    <br />
    <p>Hi! Thanks for checking out my website! I'm a software engineer currently working at Vail Systems. 
    My most proficient language is Java, and I'm always seeking to learn more about Object Orient Programming and Web Design. 
    I also plan to create gaming content on YouTube in the future and I currently stream on Twitch twice a week. 
    I stream competitive Pokemon and Smash currently along with single player focus games.</p>
